  HI, I'm Andrei. Just a quiet chaos waiting to happen... caffeine-fueled,  
  running on 4 hours of sleep, and somehow surviving last-minute submissions.
</p>

<p>
  I live in Barangay Tibig at Bulakan, Bulacan, and Im currently studying at  
  ICI Balagtas as a Grade 12 ICT student. It's fun, but Im barely surviving the lessons.
</p>

<p>
  I love playing RTS games, War Thunder, FPS games, and basically anything with action.  
  I mostly play in the afternoon to pass time before I dive into my schoolwork.
</p>

<p>
  I also love reading poems, particularly from the mid-19th and 20th century,  
  as well as books of all kinds.  
  Thatâ€™s all for now, I guess.
