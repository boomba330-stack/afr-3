    HI, I'm Andrei. Just a quiet chaos waiting to happen... caffeine-fueled,
    running on 4 hours of sleep, and somehow surviving last-minute submissions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I live in Barangay Tibig at Bulakan, Bulacan, and Im currently studying at
    ICI Balagtas as a Grade 12 ICT student. It's fun, but Im barely surviving the lessons.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love playing RTS games, War Thunder, FPS games, and basically anything with action.
    I mostly play in the afternoon to pass time before I dive into my schoolwork.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also love reading poems, particularly from the mid-19th and 20th century,
    as well as books of all kinds.
    Thatâ€™s all for now, I guess.
  </p>
