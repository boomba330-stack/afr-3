<p>Vinyl sleeves serve as protective covers that shield the records from dust, scratches, and 
    damage while also providing a canvas for artwork and design that enhances the listening experience.</p>
<p>They help in identifying the album or soundtrack, often featuring the title, artist, and unique visual themes that reflect 
    the music inside.</p> 
<p>Sleeves also make storing and organizing records easier, ensuring that each vinyl stays secure and 
    well-preserved over time.</p>
<p>In collections, they add an aesthetic and collectible value, turning the vinyl into both a 
    functional music format and a piece of visual art.</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS VINYL SLEEVES ARE FROM A GAME AND IS A COLLECTION OF SOUNDTRACKS</p>
